# verl backend (rollout gateway)

Train agents deployed on Bedrock AgentCore Runtime (ACR) with [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl),
using the in-repo [rollout gateway](../../rollout_gateway/) for token-level trajectory
capture.

The integration uses verl's public v1 agent-loop interface. Replay buffering,
filtering, checkpointing, rollout correction, worker execution, and data-parallel
balancing remain verl-owned.

## Trainer modes

verl's built-in `trainer.v1.trainer_mode` values work when every rollout is
guaranteed to produce exactly one training row. `trainer.py` registers one
`agentcore_*` name per verl v1 backend for the case where a rollout may produce
several rows, and for AgentCore-specific observability:

| `trainer.v1.trainer_mode` | wraps verl's |
|---|---|
| `agentcore_sync` | `sync` |
| `agentcore_colocate_async` | `colocate_async` |
| `agentcore_separate_async` | `separate_async` |

Each is that verl trainer plus three mixins from
[`trainer_mixins/`](trainer_mixins/) — `VariableRowBatchingMixin` (below),
`AgentLoopMetricsMixin` (agent-reported metrics as tracker series and
`reward_extra_info`), and `AdvantageZeroMetricsMixin` (collapsed-GRPO-group
accounting). An `agentcore_*` name is only a registry key: the trainer writes
verl's own mode string back into `trainer.v1.trainer_mode` before the base
trainer initializes, because `PPOTrainer` compares that string literally to pick
the replay buffer, refill semantics, and the `trainer.v1.<mode>` config node it
reads `parameter_sync_step` from.

Register the modes by naming the module in `VERL_USE_EXTERNAL_MODULES` before
running `python -m verl.trainer.main_ppo`:

```bash
export VERL_USE_EXTERNAL_MODULES=agentcore_rl_toolkit.backends.verl.trainer
```

verl imports the external module in the driver and inherited Ray actor
environments before its process-local trainer lookup. On a cluster started with
`ray start`, the variable must already be in each node's environment — verl does
not forward it.

### Variable-row batching

`VariableRowBatchingMixin` keeps the configured actor optimizer schedule stable
when one rollout expands into a variable number of trajectory rows. verl's `step`
splits a training batch into `parameter_sync_step` `sample -> update` triggers, so
with

```
M = data.train_batch_size / parameter_sync_step / actor.ppo_mini_batch_size
```

the trainer pads only to `actor_data_parallel_size * M` and sends
`num_mini_batch=M` to the actor worker instead of verl's fixed
`mini_batch_size`. The expanded row count can therefore change the number of rows
in each mini-batch without silently creating additional optimizer steps. `M`
reduces to `train_batch_size / ppo_mini_batch_size` for `agentcore_sync` and
`agentcore_colocate_async` (both held to `parameter_sync_step=1`) and to `1` for
`agentcore_separate_async`, which verl requires to satisfy
`train_batch_size == parameter_sync_step * ppo_mini_batch_size`.

Every `agentcore_*` mode requires v1 actor-only training with distillation
disabled and `loss_agg_mode=seq-mean-token-sum`; the colocated modes additionally
require `parameter_sync_step=1`, since they sleep their rollout engines for the
whole training pass and a second trigger would wait forever. Unsupported
configurations fail at startup. The loss mode ensures that expanded rows add
token-loss mass without replacing the configured pre-expansion denominator; other
aggregation modes change that normalization or weighting. With `M=1`, all emitted
rows are optimized together. With `M > 1`, rows from one rollout may cross
optimizer steps, although the configured step count and additive weighting within
each step remain stable. See the
[variable-row batching design](../../../../designs/verl_variable_trajectory_batching.md)
for the derivation.

## How it works

```
verl main_ppo (v1) ──> AgentLoopWorker ──> AgentCoreAgentLoop.run()
                                             │  1. create gateway session (sid = uuid4)
                                             │  2. RolloutClient.invoke_async(session_id=sid,
                                             │       base_url=<gateway>/v1)  ────────────> ACR agent
   RolloutGateway (thread, this process) <───┼─────  agent's OpenAI/Anthropic calls
     └─ VerlSamplingBackend ──> verl LLMServerClient (token-in/token-out, sticky by sid)
                                             │  3. await S3 result (completion signal + optional reward)
                                             │  4. finish_session -> TraceRecords -> AgentLoopOutputs
```

- The **capture session key travels in the payload**: the loop generates one sid per
  rollout, passes it as both the ACR `runtimeSessionId` and `_rollout.api_key`; the
  agent container puts `payload["_rollout"]["api_key"]` in its LLM client's api-key
  slot; the gateway reads it back from the Bearer/`X-Api-Key` slot.
- The advertised `base_url` follows the OpenAI-SDK convention and **includes `/v1`**
  (the SDK appends `/chat/completions`) — pass it to an OpenAI-compatible client
  verbatim. TODO: it is not directly usable by Anthropic-SDK agents (that SDK
  appends `/v1/messages` and does not normalize an existing `/v1`, yielding
  `/v1/v1/messages`); how to serve both SDK families cleanly is unresolved.
- One gateway per AgentLoopWorker process, serving on an auto-assigned port.
  **ACR containers must be able to reach the trainer's CPU nodes on that port.**
  Use `gateway_public_host` if the Ray node IP is not what ACR can reach.
- A session's trajectory tree can fork (sub-agents, context compaction); every leaf
  becomes its own training row (`run()` returns `list[AgentLoopOutput]`) — hence the
  hard `trainer.use_v1=true` requirement.

**Securing the gateway port.** By default the gateway opens a session on the first
turn it sees for any Bearer, so if the port is reachable from outside a trusted
network a stranger can POST `/v1/chat/completions` with an arbitrary Bearer — free
inference plus garbage trajectory trees in the trainer. Set
`require_registered_sessions: true` (on `AgentCoreAgentLoop`, forwarded to
`get_or_start_gateway`/`RolloutGateway`) to refuse any sid the loop did not
pre-register via `create_session` with a `401`; health and `/v1/models` probes stay
unauthenticated. It defaults to `false` (unchanged behaviour) and is process-shared
like `gateway_port` — the first agent loop's value wins. **Recommended whenever the
gateway port is reachable from outside a trusted network** (public networking mode,
NAT, or any setup where the trainer nodes are not on an isolated VPC).

The agent must forward the trainer-supplied key when it constructs its model client:

```python
rollout_config = payload["_rollout"]
api_key = rollout_config.get("api_key") or "EMPTY"
model = OpenAIModel(
    client_args={"api_key": api_key, "base_url": rollout_config["base_url"]},
    model_id=rollout_config["model_id"],
    params=rollout_config.get("sampling_params", {}),
)
```

The `"EMPTY"` fallback supports local evaluation and unauthenticated inference
endpoints.

## Install

verl is pinned to version 0.9.0. From a checkout of this repo:

```bash
uv sync --extra verl
```

The pinned stack uses CUDA 13 wheels and requires driver >= 580.65.06 and compute
capability >= 7.5. `flash-attn` comes from Astral's prebuilt GPU wheel index, so a
local CUDA toolkit is not required for installation.

### Megatron engine

Megatron requires Python 3.12:

```bash
uv sync --extra verl --group verl-megatron
```

- Use NVIDIA Megatron-Bridge with `megatron.use_mbridge=True` and
  `megatron.vanilla_mbridge=False`.

#### Context parallelism on VL models: apply the megatron-bridge patch

**Required for `context_parallel_size > 1` on a vision-language architecture** (e.g. Qwen3.6-27B / `Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration`, which carries a `vision_config` even when the task is text-only). Run it after every `uv sync`, since uv reinstalls the package and reverts the edit:

```bash
./patches/apply-megatron-bridge-cp-clamp.sh    # from the repo root; idempotent
```

To check whether it is currently applied:

```bash
grep -c "LOCAL PATCH (agentcore-rl-toolkit)" \
  .venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/megatron/bridge/models/qwen_vl/modelling_qwen3_vl/utils.py
```

What it fixes: megatron-bridge's `qwen_vl` `preprocess_packed_seqs` pads each sequence to `align_size = tp * cp * 2`, then slices chunk one of the zigzag-CP split by position in the *padded* sequence while reading a buffer that holds only real tokens. It clamps chunk two but not chunk one, so any row shorter than `tp * cp` raises `RuntimeError: The expanded size of the tensor (N) must match the existing size (M)` from `actor_rollout_compute_log_prob` — i.e. the rollout completes in full and then the first training-side forward pass dies, so a single short row costs the whole batch. The patch clamps chunk one the same way chunk two already is; it is a no-op on rows long enough to split, verified byte-identical on normal-length rows.

Short rows are not avoidable from config: verl synthesizes `prompt_len=1 / response_len=1` samples itself in `trainer/ppo/padding_utils.py` to make the batch divisible by the dp size. Nor is any `cp > 1` layout safer than another — the alignment depends on the `tp * cp` product, not on either alone.

Text-only models (e.g. `Qwen3MoeForCausalLM`) take verl's own THD path, never reach this function, and need none of this.

## Dataset contract: the `payload` column

A training row carries the agent's exact ACR invoke payload in a single **`payload`**
column, authored against the agent's own API — the trainer forwards it verbatim and
the agent never learns any trainer/dataset conventions:

```python
# one row, e.g. for examples/strands_math_agent (rl_app.py reads prompt + answer)
{"payload": {"prompt": "Natalia sold clips to...", "answer": "72"}}
```

verl's dataloader machinery needs a chat-format `prompt` column internally;
**`PayloadDataset`** synthesizes it at load time from `payload["prompt"]`, so
dataset authors never write that ceremony column. If your payloads name the
prompt field differently (say `input`), point the synthesis at it with
`+data.payload_prompt_field=input` — a mismatched field fails loudly at dataset
load, never silently:

```yaml
data:
  custom_cls:
    path: pkg://agentcore_rl_toolkit.backends.verl.dataset
    name: PayloadDataset
```

Rows that already have an explicit chat-format `prompt` column are left untouched.

The `payload` column is the **single** dataset contract: rows without it fail
loudly at the first rollout. Payload values must contain only JSON-serializable
types. Plain row fields are never forwarded because the row namespace is shared
with verl's own plumbing fields.

Dataset fields alongside `payload` are reserved for **dispatch metadata** (routing,
not agent input). In particular, `agent` is the designated field for routing rows to
different ACR endpoints if multi-endpoint training lands — don't put dispatch
concerns inside `payload`.

## Rewards

The reward is **built into the agent** (`reward_mode="built_in"`, the only supported
mode): the agent returns `{"rewards": ...}` in its session result (scalar or list;
last element wins). The score becomes `rm_scores` directly and verl skips reward
computation.

- Failed rollouts that still train (see [Failure handling](#failure-handling)) score 0.0.
- A healthy rollout that returns no reward is a contract violation: warned, scored 0.0.
- A non-numeric `rewards` value raises because it indicates a recurring
  agent-side contract error. verl contains the exception to the affected prompt
  group, so training continues without rows from that group.

To aggregate numeric fields from the agent result's `metrics` dict, declare each
field and its missing-value default under `reward_extra_info_defaults` in
`agentcore_agent.yaml`. Only declared fields are forwarded, so every rollout has
the same keys. `reward` is omitted because verl derives it from `rm_scores`.

**Trainer-side rewards (`reward_mode="separate"`) are not supported yet** and are
rejected at startup because verl's v1 reward managers require dataset columns that
the payload-first contract does not provide.

## Examples

- [GSM8K with FSDP full fine-tuning](examples/math_agent/)
- [MigrationBench with Megatron and LoRA](examples/migration_agent/)
- [Public setup guide](../../../../docs/site/src/content/docs/guides/verl-backend-setup.md)

Each recipe separates verl configuration in its shell script from
`AgentCoreAgentLoop` kwargs in `agentcore_agent.yaml`. Shell-script arguments accept
Hydra overrides, but loop kwargs are loaded worker-side and are not CLI-addressable;
edit the YAML or use `${oc.env:...}` interpolation.

## Trainer observability

Every `agentcore_*` mode logs, per actor update, `batching/total_real_rows`,
`batching/total_rows`, `batching/total_padding_rows`, and
`training/rollout_failure/total_missing_sessions` (nominal rollouts for the trigger
minus the distinct sessions actually seen). These are per-trigger counts, and verl
reduces a step's metrics by name: the `total_*` naming is what makes all four sum
across the triggers of a step (separate-async with `parameter_sync_step > 1`) rather
than being sample-weighted-averaged. The metric mixins add
`agent_loop/<name>/{mean,min,max,sum}` for every metric an agent loop reports
through `AgentLoopOutput.extra_fields`, plus `critic/advantages/zero_mean` and
`critic/advantages/zero_pass_mean` for collapsed GRPO groups.

## Token budgets

The integration keeps four limits separate:

- `rollout.max_model_len` is the inference engine's model-context capacity. It
  must be set explicitly; verl validates it against the model's Hugging
  Face `max_position_embeddings`.
- `prompt_length` is verl's fixed storage width for the leading context of each
  emitted training row; it does not cap the prompts the gateway sends to the
  inference engine. A row may begin at the first model turn or at a later
  trajectory fork, so its leading context can include a long accumulated
  multi-turn prompt.
- `response_length` is verl's storage width for everything after the leading
  prompt region and the gateway's cumulative trajectory budget. It must not
  exceed `max_model_len`.
- `max_tokens_per_turn` is a required `agentcore_agent.yaml` setting. It becomes
  the gateway's default `max_new_tokens` for each model call; a smaller request
  limit and the remaining model context can clamp it further.

To let variable-length prompts use the full model window, set
`response_length = max_model_len` and enable
`actor_rollout_ref.model.use_remove_padding=true`. This gives verl a nominal
`prompt_length + response_length` padded width, but the gateway limits valid
tokens to `max_model_len`. If both lengths equal `max_model_len`, the nominal
row width is therefore `2 * max_model_len`; remove-padding avoids most model
compute on padding, but the wider fixed-width staging tensors still increase
memory and transfer overhead. Set `prompt_length` high enough for the leading
contexts expected in emitted rows (or to `max_model_len` to rule out overflow).
If a leading context does exceed `prompt_length`, the adapter preserves its
overflow at the front of the response region with loss mask and rollout logprob
zero. Training remains correct, but verl's existing length metrics count those
overflow tokens as part of the response region, so overflow should be a
fallback rather than the normal configuration.

Trace-less rollout failures raise from the agent loop and produce no synthetic
training row. With synchronous replay, successful sessions for the same prompt
remain trainable. With asynchronous replay, verl's existing failed-group policy
evicts and refills the entire prompt group, including successful sibling
trajectories. Preserving partial failed groups in asynchronous training requires
session-level or partial-group failure handling in verl's replay buffer.
The `training/rollout_failure/total_missing_sessions` metric reports
`data.train_batch_size / parameter_sync_step * rollout.n` minus the number of
materialized rollout sessions in each actor update, summed over a step's updates.

## Failure handling

A failed rollout is classified, then trained at reward 0, retried, or dropped. Rules
match in order and never inspect error text:

| Class | Matches | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | the gateway answered a context-limit error for the session (`max_context_tokens` filled); the last captured turn ended with `finish_reason == "length"`; a timeout under `timeout_policy: penalize` | train at reward 0 (dropped if no tokens were captured) |
| `timeout` | the `max_rollout_time` deadline passed (`timeout_policy: drop`) | drop |
| `transient` | `invoke_async` raised (after boto retries), polling S3 raised, or `status_code == 500` with zero captured model turns | retry on a fresh session id, then drop |
| `agent_error` | any other non-200 `status_code`, e.g. a traceback after model turns | drop (train at 0 with `drop_agent_errors: false`) |

A non-numeric reward still raises, as described under [Rewards](#rewards).

Dropping raises `RolloutDropped` (a `RuntimeError` with `.failure_class`) from the
agent loop. With synchronous replay only that trajectory is lost, its siblings train,
and it counts toward `total_missing_sessions`. With asynchronous replay, verl evicts
and refills the whole prompt group (see above), so drops cost more there.

A retry discards the old gateway session, waits a jittered 2–5 s, and invokes again
under a new session id. The first attempt and all retries share one `max_rollout_time`
deadline. No retry starts if the backoff would overrun the deadline, so a retried
rollout never holds a step longer than an unretried one could.

`agentcore_agent.yaml` kwargs:

| Kwarg | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `drop_agent_errors` | `true` | drop `agent_error` rollouts; `false` trains their partial traces at reward 0 (the old behaviour) |
| `max_rollout_retries` | `1` | retries for `transient` failures; `0` drops them immediately |
| `timeout_policy` | `drop` | `drop`, or `penalize` to train timed-out partial traces at reward 0 as `model` |

Each decision logs one line at WARNING level:

```text
[rollout-failure] class=<model|transient|agent_error|timeout> action=<train|retry|drop> sid=<sid> step=<global_steps> reason=<first 200 chars, newlines replaced by spaces>
```

These lines come from agent-loop worker processes. Ray forwards worker output to the
driver (`log_to_driver` defaults to true, and verl does not override it), with a
`(AgentLoopWorker pid=...)` prefix and possibly a logging-format prefix, so match the
line anywhere, not at the start. Ray's driver-side deduplication (`RAY_DEDUP_LOGS`,
on by default) ignores words containing digits, so it collapses lines that differ only
in sid or step when different workers emit them within 5 s. It prints them once
followed by `[repeated Nx across cluster]`. Set
`RAY_DEDUP_LOGS_ALLOW_REGEX='\[rollout-failure\]'` in the driver environment to keep
every line, or count with the metrics below.

`agentcore_sync` also reports, per step:

- `training/rollout_failure/total_<class>_<action>` for `model_train`, `model_drop`,
  `transient_retry`, `transient_drop`, `agent_error_train`, `agent_error_drop`, and
  `timeout_drop`. Agent loops record each decision in a named Ray actor
  (`agentcore_rollout_failure_stats`) that the trainer owns and reads at the end of
  the step, before validation.
- `training/rollout_failure/drop_fraction`: `total_missing_sessions` divided by
  `data.train_batch_size * rollout.n`.

If `drop_fraction` exceeds `trainer.v1.agentcore_max_drop_fraction` (default `0.5`;
`null` disables the guard) for `trainer.v1.agentcore_drop_guard_steps` (default `3`)
consecutive steps, the trainer raises `RolloutFailureGuardError` and includes the
step's per-class counts in the message. Both keys are new to verl's config, so pass
them with `+`, e.g. `+trainer.v1.agentcore_max_drop_fraction=0.3`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Every rollout fails, warning about "static session 'EMPTY'"**: the deployed agent
  image predates the session-key contract and sends a fixed api key — its turns
  accumulate under one shared session while each rollout's real session drains empty.
  Rebuild/redeploy the agent image with the contract above.
- **Agent-side 404s on every rollout**: an agent constructing its own URL paths
  instead of using an OpenAI/Anthropic SDK may miss the `/v1` convention (see above).
- Stop-string text trimmed by verl's rollout servers is excluded from trained ids
  (same behavior as verl's own agent loops).
- Sub-agents that reuse the same session id fork within one tree and are captured; a
  sub-agent given a *different* session id becomes a separate tree and is not joined
  to the episode (cross-session grouping is future work).
